# TrafficWARNukbak
TrafficWarnUK repository

This android project is a simple front end for the highways agency rss feeds 

    private static final String trafficURLUnplanned = "http://m.highways.gov.uk/feeds/rss/UnplannedEvents.xml";
    
I use it with my android watch Sony    Smartwatch 3 to get notifications when a traffic incident occurs with s specified radius from
my current position. 

The project is not ideally named as England, Scotland , Wales and NI seem to have their own flavour of xml / rss feeds and
only the England one seems to be updating regularly.

And even the England one from URL above can cease updating for a few days :-(

For that reason I probably wont publish this app. The actual code is usable though and you can put your own traffic icons in
